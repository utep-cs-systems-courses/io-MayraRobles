## My Blinky Buzzy Toy

This program is a silly toy that runs on an msp430. The behavior for each
button is:
- S1: Plays Canon in D while the green and red leds count to 3 in binary
- S2: Shows the dimming of lights. Red goes for dim to bright and green goes
from bright to dim. No sound.
- S3: Plays a sound that goes from low to high and high to low
- S4: Changes the color led and the note every time it is pressed
